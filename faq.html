                    <h2>What types of video production services do you offer in Canada (commercial, corporate, events, weddings)?</h2>
                    <p>We provide a comprehensive range of cinematic video production services across Canada. Our commercial video production includes promotional videos, product launches, brand storytelling content, and advertising campaigns designed for Canadian markets. Corporate video production encompasses internal communications, training videos, executive interviews, company culture videos, and annual reports. For events, we offer complete event videography services including conferences, trade shows, product launches, and corporate gatherings.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How much does cinematic video production cost in Canada?</h2>
                    <p>Video production costs in Canada vary significantly based on project scope, duration, location, and complexity. Basic event videography packages start around $2,500 CAD and include single-camera coverage with basic editing. Corporate video production typically ranges from $3,500 to $15,000 CAD depending on the number of shooting days, interviews, and post-production requirements. Commercial video production projects range from $5,000 to $25,000 CAD or more for complex campaigns with multiple locations, actors, and extensive post-production. Wedding videography Canada packages range from $3,000 to $8,000 CAD including ceremony and reception coverage, highlight reels, and full-length documentaries. Drone videography adds $500 to $1,500 CAD depending on location and flight requirements. All quotes include GST/HST as applicable by province.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Do you travel for shoots across Canada, and are travel fees different by province?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we travel throughout Canada for video production projects. Our team is based in major Canadian cities and we regularly work across all provinces and territories. Travel fees vary by distance and location accessibility. For shoots within 100km of our base locations, travel is typically included in the package price. For destinations requiring flights, we charge actual airfare costs plus accommodation and ground transportation. Remote locations in Northern Canada, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut may require additional logistics planning and costs. We provide detailed travel estimates during the quoting process and work to minimize costs by scheduling multiple projects in the same region when possible. Provincial differences mainly affect accommodation costs and local permit requirements rather than our base travel fees.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How far in advance should I book a videographer for an event or wedding in Canada?</h2>
                    <p>For optimal availability and planning, we recommend booking our videographer Canada services 3-6 months in advance for weddings and major events. Wedding videography Canada bookings should ideally be secured 6-12 months ahead, especially for popular wedding seasons (May through October) and holiday weekends. Corporate events and commercial video production can often be accommodated with 4-8 weeks notice, depending on scope and location. Rush projects with less than 2 weeks notice may incur expedited service fees. Early booking ensures your preferred dates are available, allows time for thorough pre-production planning, location scouting, and permit acquisition. It also provides opportunity for engagement sessions or pre-event meetings to discuss your vision and requirements in detail.</p>

                    <h2>What is included in your video production packages (filming, editing, colour grading, audio, revisions)?</h2>
                    <p>Our comprehensive video production packages include professional 4K video filming with multiple camera angles, professional lighting setup, and high-quality audio recording using wireless microphones and boom operators. Post-production services encompass video editing with smooth transitions and pacing, professional colour grading to ensure consistent and cinematic look, audio mixing and enhancement, basic motion graphics and titles, and music licensing for appropriate background tracks. All packages include two rounds of revisions to ensure your satisfaction with the final product. Additional services available include advanced motion graphics, custom animation, drone videography (where permitted), live streaming capabilities, and rush delivery options. We provide final deliverables in multiple formats optimized for web, social media, broadcast, and archival purposes.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How long does video editing and delivery usually take after filming?</h2>
                    <p>Standard video editing and delivery timelines vary by project complexity. Event videography highlight reels are typically delivered within 2-3 weeks after filming, with full-length event documentation taking 3-4 weeks. Wedding videography Canada projects require 4-6 weeks for highlight reels and 6-8 weeks for complete wedding films due to the extensive footage and detailed editing required. Commercial and corporate video production timelines range from 2-4 weeks depending on the amount of footage, graphics requirements, and revision rounds. Rush delivery is available for an additional fee, reducing timelines by 50% for urgent projects. We provide regular updates throughout the editing process and share rough cuts for feedback before final delivery. All projects include cloud-based delivery with download links and optional physical media delivery.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Can you film in 4K, and do you offer vertical video for Instagram Reels and TikTok?</h2>
                    <p>Absolutely! All our cameras are capable of 4K video filming, which is our standard recording format for maximum quality and future-proofing your content. We understand the importance of social media content and specifically plan for vertical video formats during filming. Our team captures additional footage optimized for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Instagram Stories in 9:16 aspect ratio. We also create square format versions for Instagram feed posts and traditional 16:9 formats for YouTube and website use. During post-production, we deliver multiple format versions of your content optimized for different platforms, ensuring your investment in professional videography extends across all your marketing channels. This multi-format approach maximizes the value and reach of your video content across Canadian and international audiences.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Do you provide drone videography, and what Transport Canada rules apply to drone filming?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we offer professional drone videography Canada services with Transport Canada certified pilots. Our drone operations comply with all Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) including maintaining visual line of sight, respecting altitude limits, and avoiding restricted airspace around airports and urban areas. We handle all necessary permits and notifications required for commercial drone operations. Transport Canada rules require drone pilots to hold valid certificates for commercial operations, maintain minimum distances from people and property, and operate only in approved airspace. We cannot fly in National Parks, near airports, or in controlled airspace without special permissions. Weather conditions, including wind speed and visibility, also affect drone operations. We assess each location's feasibility during pre-production and obtain all required authorizations before your shoot date.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Do you help with scripting, storyboarding, and creative direction for brand videos?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we provide comprehensive pre-production services including scripting, storyboarding, and creative direction for brand storytelling video projects. Our creative team works closely with you to develop compelling narratives that align with your brand values and marketing objectives. We start with discovery sessions to understand your target audience, key messages, and desired outcomes. Our scriptwriting process includes multiple drafts and revisions to ensure the content resonates with Canadian audiences and meets your specific goals. Storyboarding helps visualize the final product and ensures efficient filming days. We also provide creative direction for visual style, colour palettes, music selection, and overall aesthetic that matches your brand identity. This collaborative approach ensures your commercial video production effectively communicates your message while maintaining professional cinematic quality.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Who owns the footage, and how does music licensing work for Canadian businesses?</h2>
                    <p>Upon final payment, clients receive full ownership rights to their finished video content and can use it for any business purposes without additional licensing fees from us. Raw footage ownership varies by package and can be negotiated during contracting. For music licensing, we use properly licensed tracks from professional music libraries that include Canadian commercial use rights. These licenses cover broadcast, web, and social media use within Canada. For projects requiring specific songs or popular music, we can arrange additional licensing through SOCAN (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada) and other rights organizations, though this involves additional costs. We always ensure all music used in your videos is properly licensed to avoid copyright issues. Custom music composition is also available for projects requiring unique soundtracks that provide complete ownership and exclusivity.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Can you provide bilingual (English/French) versions or subtitles for Canadian audiences?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we offer bilingual video production services to serve Canada's diverse linguistic landscape. We can create separate English and French versions of your content with native-speaking voice-over artists and culturally appropriate adaptations. For existing content, we provide professional translation services and subtitle creation in both official languages. Our bilingual capabilities are particularly valuable for government contracts, national campaigns, and Quebec market expansion. We work with certified translators to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity in French-Canadian markets. Subtitle services include proper timing, formatting, and compliance with Canadian broadcasting standards. We can also provide subtitles in other languages to serve Canada's multicultural communities. This service is especially important for corporate communications, training videos, and public service announcements that need to reach all Canadian audiences effectively.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How do you handle permits and filming permissions for public locations in Canadian cities?</h2>
                    <p>We handle all permit applications and location permissions required for filming in Canadian public spaces. Each city and province has different requirements, and we're familiar with the processes across major Canadian municipalities including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Ottawa, and others. Typical permits are required for filming in parks, on streets, in government buildings, and other public properties. Application timelines vary from 2-4 weeks depending on location and complexity. Costs range from $100 to $1,000+ depending on location, duration, and equipment requirements. We factor permit costs and timelines into project planning and provide detailed breakdowns during quoting. For private locations, we coordinate directly with property owners and managers. Our experience with Canadian filming regulations ensures smooth production days without legal complications or unexpected delays that could impact your project timeline and budget.</p>
